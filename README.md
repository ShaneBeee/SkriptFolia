# Skript Folia
This is a fork of Skript which has some basic support for [**Folia**](https://papermc.io/software/folia).  

Please see the [**original Skript repo**](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) for all information regarding Skript.

This fork aims to match the original Skript, with minor changes to work with Folia.

## Notable Changes:
Please see [**Wiki**](https://github.com/ShaneBeee/SkriptFolia/wiki) for notable changes.

## Addons:
Most addons for Skript will not work, as they explicitly require changes to work on Folia.  

Some addons that will work:
- [**SkBee**](https://github.com/ShaneBeee/SkBee) currently DOES support Folia.
- [**Skript-Reflect-Folia**](https://github.com/ShaneBeee/skript-reflect-folia) is a fork of Skript-Reflect that will work on Folia.
